# house-of-carbs
The House of Carbs is a system that automatically estimates and dispenses the amount of juice (or similar) according to the current patients' blood glucose values. The system is remotely accessible and customizable from a chatbot, exploits sensors and actuators to dispense the necessary amount of liquid carbohydrates. It relies on a cloud solution (Nightscout) to acquire the patient's blood glucose values, which are constantly updated thanks to a commercial wearable continuous glucose monitor (CGM).
